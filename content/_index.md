#### Objectives of the Workshop

In this workshop, you'll explore how to set up and configure Amazon Bedrock Guardrails through a hands-on sample scenario.

Amazon Bedrock Guardrails empowers you to establish policies that help protect your generative AI applications from producing or interacting with unsafe content. With Guardrails, you can tailor content moderation rules to meet the specific needs of your application.

Youâ€™ll be able to configure two key types of safeguards:

- **Denied Topics:** Specify topics that should be restricted in your application. For instance, a virtual assistant for online banking can be configured to avoid giving investment advice.

- **Content Filters:** Set sensitivity thresholds to detect and block potentially harmful content in categories such as hate speech, insults, sexually explicit material, and violence.
